        <p>
          While she has an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from the University of Queensland she changed
          domains to software as she discovered it satisfies her creative itch while being technically
          challenging. She loves to talk about the benefits of test automation, logs, monitoring and observability,
          and listening to other peopleâ€™s passions.
